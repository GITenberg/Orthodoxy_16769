description: "Orthodoxy (1908) is a book by G. K. Chesterton that has become a classic\
  \ of Christian apologetics. Chesterton considered this book a companion to his other\
  \ work, Heretics, writing it expressly in response to G.S. Street's criticism of\
  \ the earlier work, \"that he was not going to bother about his theology until I\
  \ had really stated mine\". In the book's preface Chesterton states the purpose\
  \ is to \"attempt an explanation, not of whether the Christian faith can be believed,\
  \ but of how he personally has come to believe it.\" In it, Chesterton presents\
  \ an original view of Christian religion. He sees it as the answer to natural human\
  \ needs, the \"answer to a riddle\" in his own words, and not simply as an arbitrary\
  \ truth received from somewhere outside the boundaries of human experience.\nThe\
  \ book was written when Chesterton was an Anglican. He converted to Catholicism\
  \ 14 years later. Chesterton chose the title, Orthodoxy, to focus instead on the\
  \ plainness of the Apostles' Creed, though he admitted the general sound of the\
  \ title was \"a thinnish sort of thing\".\nOrthodoxy was influential in the conversion\
  \ of Theodore Maynard to Roman Catholicism.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
